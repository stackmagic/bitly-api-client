[0.7.1]

* FIX: Issue#2 (https://github.com/stackmagic/bitly-api-client/issues/2) where a gson exception was thrown on error responses from bitly. Just checking the status field for a value of 200 would break UserLinkSaveIntegrationTest where a 304 is returned along with a valid data field. So we first try to deserialize and only in case of error we'll do a partial deserialize. There's a new field deserialize_error in the response to indicate that the data field will be null as a result of an error

[0.5.0]

more or less feature complete. most metrics are there with an expanded variant, the rolledup one needs a closer look and once I've figured out how this stuff actually works I'll add it too but for the moment this is a pretty usable state right now.
